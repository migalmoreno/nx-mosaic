* nx-mosaic
=nx-mosaic= is an extensible and configurable new-buffer page for Nyxt. It's inspired by [[https://tabliss.io/][Tabliss]], and aims to create a Nyxt-native new-buffer page experience users can adapt to their needs.

Currently supported widgets include personal greeting, clock/date, and wallpapers, and support for new ones is on the road-map.
